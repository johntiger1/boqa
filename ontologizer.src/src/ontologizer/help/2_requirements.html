 <h1><font color="blue">Requirements</font></h1>
  <p>This page describes what you will need to use the Ontologizer to
  analyze microarray or similar data. In general, it should not require more than
  about 10 minutes to get things set up and download the required files.</p>

  <P>If you are reading this, then you very likely have a run-time environment for Java version 5.0 or later, installed on your
  system. The Ontologizer can be run as a Java webstart application directly from the Ontologizer website. Alternatively, you can
  download the ontologizer.jar file and run it locally. In general, we recommend using the webstart version because updates
  and improvements will automatically be downloaded whenever the application is started via webstart.
  </P>
  <P>The Ontologizer uses two external programs (libraries). Although the Ontologizer will work without them, it is highly recommended
  that users install these programs to enjoy the full functionality of the Ontologizer:
   <ul>
    <li>GraphViz: This is a well-known graph drawing program that should be installed on your system (the Ontologizer will
    find the location of the program automatically). See the GraphViz <a href="http://www.graphviz.org">website</a> 
    for details on installing GraphViz.</li>
   </ul>  
  <p>Finally, users need to download a GO term definition file as well as an annotation file for the species they are analyzing.
  These files are briefly described in the following sections.</p>
  
 <H1><FONT COLOR="BLUE">The gene_ontology.obo file</FONT></H1>
 <a name="obo"></a>
<P>The <B>gene_ontology.obo</B> file contains the definitions for each of the gene ontology terms. 
GO terms are organized in structures called directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), which differ from hierarchies (tree structures) in that a child, or more specialized, term can have many parent, or less specialized, terms. The gene_ontology.obo file contains both
information about individual terms such as the GO id (e.g., GO:0004386), the name (e.g.,  helicase activity), a longer
description, as well as the information needed to reconstruct the DAG from the entries. The Ontologizer users an internal 
representation of the GO DAG in order to calculate the annotation count for genes or gene products.</P>
<P>
Users should download the gene_ontology.obo file from the Gene Ontology website. This file is updated every 30 minutes. In general, it
is important to use annotation files and obo files that are both up to date, because the structure and contents of GO are change on a regular basis (due to corrections, additions, and other modifications).
</P>


<H1><FONT COLOR="BLUE">Association Files</FONT></H1>
 <a name="annot"></a>
<P>In order to use the Ontologizer, users need to download the GO annotation file for the species they are interested in
analyzing. Annotation files for about 30 species are available at present from the GO website, and many others are in
development. These files are called <B>"gene_annotation.xyz"</B>, where <b>xyz</b> is an abbreviation of the consortium that has
contributed the annotations. For instance, gene_annotation.wb is from WormBase for <I>C. elegans.</I></P>
<P>
Users can download gene_association.xyz files for about 30 species directly from the Gene Ontology website. 
These files are generally updated on a monthly basis or somewhat less often, depending on the consortium.
</P>


 
 
 <H1><FONT COLOR="BLUE">Gene Lists</FONT></H1>
 <a name="input"></a>
<P>Users need to provide lists of genes or gene products they want to analyze. One or multiple lists, one to a file, can
be provided. Acceptable formats are one-gene-to-a-line and for the commandline version also FASTA. Note that the gene names need to be compatible
to the names used in the gene_association file. This can be problematic in some situations, for instance when analyzing
results of Affymetrix microarray experiments because many of the probesets are based on EST sequences. EST accession numbers
are generally not used for the gene_association files. However, Ontologizer is capable of reading the annotation files as provided by Affymetrix so instead of the
gene_association file you might wish to provide that one. Alternatively, you can ask the software producing the lists to use GeneIDs. Note that most convenient way to find out,
whether a entry actually has annotations is to check the editing field in the main window as here genes from which the information is avaiable are highligthed.

<H1><FONT COLOR="BLUE">Problems with RAM</FONT></H1>
 <a name="ram"></a>
<P>If a local version of the Ontologizer is started from the
command line for analysis of large datasets, it may be necessary to have the Java Virtual Machine preallocate
more memory. This can be done by starting the Ontologizer as follows:
</P>
<P><B>&gt;java -Xmx768m -jar Ontologizer.jar.</B>
</P>
<P>The flag -Xmx768m gives the VM a 768MByte heap maximum (less initially), and the flag -Xms256m would make the heap start at 256MB. </P>
