   <h1><FONT COLOR="BLUE">Results</FONT></h1>
   <p>This page describes how to interpret the results of analysis with the Ontologizer.</p>

  <ul>
   <li><a href="#table">Main Table</a></li>

  </ul>
  
  <H1><FONT COLOR="BLUE">Main Table</FONT></H1>
 <a name="table"></a>
 <p>Once the Ontologizer is finished with the calculations, a Table is shown with a summary of the
 results for each GO term with at least one annotation in the study set. Each term is shown on
 a separate row. The meaning of the columns is as follows:</p>
 <ul>
 <li><b>GO id</b>: The accession number of the GO term</li>
 <li><b>Name</b>: The name of the GO term</li>
 <li><b>NSP</b>: The namespace, or subontology: biological process (<B>B</b>), cellular component (<B>C</b>)
 or molecular function (<B>F</b>)</li>
 <li><b>P-value</b>: The nominal (uncorrected) P-value resulting from the observed overrepresentation of the GO term</li>
 <li><b>Adj. P-Value</b>: The adjusted P-Value (adjusted by the MTC procedure chosen by the user)</li>
 <li><b>Pop. Count</b>: The number of genes in the population set that are annotated to the GO term in question</li>
 
 <li><b>Study Count</b>: The number of genes in the study set that are annotated to the GO term in question</li>
 </ul>

  <p>Note that the significant terms are marked in color, whereby the terms from biological process are shown in green,
  terms from molecular function in yellow and terms from cellular component in magenta.</p>
  <p>Marking any term in the table causes more detailed information about the term to be shown in the
  lower half of the window, with the full term definition as well as a list of parent and child terms. Users can 
  click on the entries of the parent or child terms to go to their entries.</p>
  <P>The table can be saved as a text file that can be used as input to R or other programs.</p>

<a name="graph"></a>
<p>A click on the "graph" button (third from left on the upper right) will cause a Graph-Viz-generated graph to be
displayed on the right hand side of the window. The significant terms as well as all ancestor terms of the significant
terms are shown, and the significant terms are color-coded as in the table. Clicking on a node in the graph
causes the corresxponding term to be selected in the table.</p>
 <H1><FONT COLOR="BLUE">Selections</FONT></H1>
<a name="select"></a> 
<p>It is possible to restrict the list of terms displayed in the table to all descendents of a given term. For instance,
users may want to view all terms from the subontology cellular_component. To do so, enter the name of the term
in the text box "<b>Display all terms emanating from...</b>". Note that there is an underslash for the terms of the three 
subontologies biological_process, cellular_component, and molecular_function.
</p>
<p>Users can select additional terms or can remove terms from the graphical display by checking or unchecking the
select boxes in the table. To regenerate the graph, double-click on the "graph" button. </p>
