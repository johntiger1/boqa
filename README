We release the source code under the ClearBSD license. Additional,
we grant the usage of the patent for academic purposes that have no
commercial interests. Other parties have to contact one of the
authors for obtaining permission or a license.

Usage

In order to start the benchmark, just invoke the supplied
makefile. You need Java, ant, and R for successfully
completing the benchmark process. Look into the code for
more details about the implementation and how to use it in
your own research project. Remember that it also often helps
to just read the supplied tests to understand how to use an 
API. In particular, the BOQA implementation is tested in
BOQATest class.
