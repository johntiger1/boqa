   <H1>Population set</H1>
<P>After the main Ontologizer window appears, click on the button "<b>New Population Set</b>". The phrase "New Population Set"
will now appear in the workspace window. All further analyses will start from this population set. To define the
population, click on <b>Append Set...</b> in the lower right part of the window and choose the population using the 
file selection browser. The file name of the chosen file will now appear in the workspace.
1 or more study sets can now be defined for this population set (see below).
</p> 
<P>See <a href="2_requirements.html">Requirements</a>
for a description of allowed formats for the population and study sets.</p>
 
 
 <a name="study"></a>
  <H1>Study set</H1>
<P>Make sure the name of the population set to which you want to append a study set is marked in the
workspace window. Then click on <b>New Study Set</b>. The phrase "New Study Set" will appear in the
workspace beneath the population set. Click on the button <b>Append Set...</b> (same as above) to open a file
selection dialog with which to choose the study set file. The name of the chosen file will
then appear in the workspace. The <b>Remove</b> button can be used to remove study set or population files.
This step can be repeated multiple times to 
analyze multiple study sets belonging to one population set.</P>
<p>The names of the genes of the currently selected study or population set appear in 
the <b>Currently Selected Set</b> window on the right. If necessary, users can edit the lists.</p>

<a name="GOfiles"></a>
<H1>GO Files</H1>
 <P>Use the settings panel to indicate the location of the GO term definition file (<I>gene_ontology.obo</i>)
 and the correct <I>gene_association</i> file. File selection dialogs will appear with which users can choose these files
 on the local file system.</p>
 
 <a name="stats"></a>
 <H1>Statistical Analysis</H1>
<P>These setting controls the method by which the annotated genes or gene products in the study set are analyzed for
GO term overrepresentation with respect to the population set. The standard method has been to calculate the upper tail
of the hypergeometric distribution (One-sided Fisher exact test) for each term separately. The Ontologizer also
provides analysis by means of the parent-child approach, which has several advantages compared to the standard approach 
(see the Ontologizer homepage for further details and references). </P>

 <a name="mtc"></a>
<H1>Multiple-Testing Correction</H1>
 <P>Given that there are thousands of GO terms, multiple testing becomes an important issue. There are
 numerous procedures for multiple testing correction (MTC). We recommend that users start with the classic Bonferroni
 correction and the Westfall-Young Single-Step (resampling) procedures. Other procedures from the false-discovery-rate (FDR)
 community are provided, but we note that the role of FDR procedures in GO analysis has not been extensively examined
 to date.</P>
 
 <a name="go!"></a>
 <H1>GO!</H1>
 <P>Once you have entered the above information, click on the <i>Analyze</i> button. A new window will
 appear, and the progress of the analysis, which will generally take a few seconds to a few minutes depending
 on the size of the dataset and the type of MTC, is displayed in the lower right part of the window. See the 
<a href="4_results.html">next section</a> for a discussion of how to interpret the results. </p>
